# Anti-Fraud System

## Project Description

Welcome to the Anti-Fraud System project! In this project, we will be building an authentication system using the Spring Security module to enhance the security of our enterprise application. Our goal is to provide different levels of access to various parts of the system for different users, ensuring a robust and secure environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into setting up the authentication for our Anti-Fraud System, make sure you have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- Relational Data Model
- SQL and its basics
- Basic data types
- Literals in programming
- Arithmetic expressions
- Familiarity with joining tables


## Authentication Setup

Our enterprise application requires a robust authentication mechanism to ensure secure access for different types of users. For this purpose, we will be using Spring Security, a battle-tested module that offers reliable authentication methods.

In this stage of the project, your tasks include:

1. Implementing HTTP Basic authentication for our REST service.
2. Utilizing JDBC implementations of `UserDetailService` for effective user management.
3. Creating an endpoint for user registration at `POST /api/auth/user`.

Feel free to explore and elaborate on these tasks, but it's a good practice to leverage the Spring Security module's existing functionality for efficiency and reliability.
